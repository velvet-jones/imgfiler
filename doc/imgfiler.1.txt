IMGFILER(1)
===========

NAME
----
imgfiler - A utility for organizing digital photos


SYNOPSIS
--------
*imgfiler* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The imgfiler(1) command re-organizes your digital photos by moving them from
'SOURCE' to a subdirectory in 'DEST' based on the date the photo was taken.


OPTIONS
-------
*-s, --source*::
    Required. The source directory containing photos you want to re-organize. Optionally, the name of a single photo.

*-d, --destination*::
    Required. The destination directory that receives the re-organized photos.
    Can be the same as the source directory.

*-l, --dateless*::
    Optional. If supplied, the program moves photos that have no date
    into this directory. Without a 'dateless' directory the program will
    skip dateless photos.

*-u, --duplicates*::
    Optional. If supplied, the program moves photos that are duplicates
    into this directory. Without a 'duplicates' directory the program
    will delete duplicate photos.

*-j, --jobs*::
    Run multiple jobs in parallel. If your disk utilization is low, increase the number of jobs
    until you hit 100%.

*--md5*::
    Use MD5 instead of SHA1 for hashing.

*--verbose*::
    Print information about each operation. Verbose is enabled by default if
    '--move' is not supplied.

*-h, --help*::
    Print instructions for using the program.

*-v, --version*::
    Print the version number of the program.

*--move*::
    Without this, the program simply suggests each operation it would like to perform.
    If this argument is supplied, the program will carry out all suggested actions.
    When invoked directly by a user, the '--verbose' option is useful to see the progress.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Failure

NOTES
-----
- The program will not make any changes to your system unless you
  provide the '--move' command line option. Without this option,
  the program simply suggests what it would do with each file.

- There are no issues with overlapping directories. You can specify the same
  directory for both source and destination.

- Photos are renamed according to their 'hash'. A hash of a digital photo is a
  long sequence of seemingly random characters that uniquely identify that photo.

- Hidden directories and files are skipped.

EXAMPLE
-------
In the directory structure below we want to scan the 'photos/uploads/' directory for new photos
and file them under 'photos/' or 'photos/dateless/'. The command line would be:

----
$ imgfiler --move --source=/photos/uploads --destination=/photos --dateless=/photos/dateless
----
